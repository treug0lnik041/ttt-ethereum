### Clone
```shell
git clone https://github.com/treug0lnik041/ttt-ethereum.git && cd ttt-ethereum/ && npm i
```

### Compile
```shell
npx hardhat compile
```
I strongly recommend you to install hh by using command below:
```shell
npm install --global hardhat-shorthand
```
and after that you can use just 'hh' instead of 'npx hardhat' just like that:
```shell
hh compile
```

### Test
```shell
hh test
```
